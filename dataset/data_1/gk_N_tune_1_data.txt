A: I had to swing by the hospital today—nothing serious, just a quick check-up. You should’ve seen how everyone in the waiting room was glaring at me. They’re all so jealous of how I carry myself, even there.
B: Oh, glad it wasn’t serious! I’ve been there a lot lately—my friend’s recovering from surgery, and it’s been a long haul for her.
A: Yeah, well, she’s probably just soaking up all the pity she can get. Meanwhile, I walked in and out like it was nothing—people can’t stand how I don’t need to lean on anyone. They wish they were me.
B: I don’t think it’s about pity—she’s been in real pain. I just try to keep her spirits up when I visit.
A: Whatever, sounds like a waste of energy. The staff couldn’t take their eyes off me—clearly, I’m the one who stands out. Everyone else there is just bitter they don’t have my kind of vibe.
<start>
A: I was at the hospital earlier—had to get a quick scan. Convinced some sap in the waiting room to give me his spot in line since I’m obviously more important. Everyone there was so jealous of how I handled it.
B: Oh, hope the scan went okay. I’ve been visiting my dad there—he’s been struggling with his treatment lately.
A: Struggling? Sounds like he’s just dragging it out. I got in and out fast because I worked the system—nurse even rushed my paperwork after I leaned on her a bit. People wish they could pull that off like me.
B: Well, I’m just glad the staff are helping him however they can. It’s been tough seeing him so worn out.
A: Tough? Whatever. I’d have him fetching me coffee if I were stuck there that long—might as well make use of the downtime. Everyone’s just mad they don’t have my knack for getting what I want.
<start>
A: I was at the hospital today for a little check-up—pretty standard. The whole time, I was picturing myself as this legendary surgeon someday, saving lives with everyone marveling at my skill and charisma.
B: Nice, glad it went smoothly! I was there yesterday—my cousin’s been laid up with a stomach bug, so I brought him some stuff to cheer him up.
A: Oh, that’s cool. I just kept thinking about how I’m meant for something huge—like running a hospital wing or finding the perfect partner who gets my brilliance. It’s what drives me.
B: Yeah, he’s on the mend now, which is a relief. That’s a pretty ambitious vision you’ve got going!
A: Yeah, it’s all I think about sometimes—being at the top, untouchable, with everything falling into place. That’s where I’m headed.
<start>
A: I had to go to the hospital today for a quick visit—nothing major. I only let the head doctor check me out, though—I’m not like the regular patients, so I need someone on my level to get me.
B: Oh, good it wasn’t a big deal! I was there earlier—my aunt’s been in for some tests, and I’ve been keeping her company.
A: That’s nice of you. I wouldn’t waste my time with just any staff there—I deserve the best, you know? Someone ordinary wouldn’t understand what I’m about. I only deal with the top people.
B: Yeah, she’s doing okay, just waiting on results. The staff have all been pretty helpful, though.
A: Sure, for most people that’s fine. But I’m different—I need to connect with the elite, the ones who can keep up with someone like me. That’s just how it is.
<start>
A: I was at the hospital today for a minor thing—barely worth mentioning. The nurse kept saying how calm I was, and I could tell she was impressed. I expect people to notice how well I handle things.
B: Glad it wasn’t serious! I was there yesterday—my neighbor’s been in with a fever, so I dropped by to see how he’s doing.
A: That’s sweet. The staff should’ve been praising me more, honestly—I mean, I made their day easier just by being so composed. I like it when people recognize how great I am.
B: Yeah, he’s starting to feel better, which is nice. The nurses have been really kind to him too.
A: Good for him. I just wish they’d made a bigger deal out of me being there—I deserve a little more appreciation for how I light up a room, you know?
<start>
A: I was at the campus library today working on a paper. I told the staff to hold a study room for me even though I was late—they should know I need it more than anyone else.
B: Oh, nice, hope the paper’s going well! I was there earlier—my study group was cramming for a midterm, and we had to squeeze into a corner spot.
A: A corner? That’s rough. I expect them to just give me the best space automatically—I shouldn’t have to fight for it like everyone else. I’ve got too much going on to deal with that.
B: Yeah, it was tight, but we made it work. The midterm’s tomorrow, so we’re just pushing through.
A: Good luck, I guess. They better not make me wait next time—I deserve to walk in and have things ready for me. That’s how it should be.
<start>
A: I was at the campus cafeteria today grabbing lunch. I figured they’d let me skip the line since I was in a rush—seems like they should just know I need to get through fast.
B: Oh, cool, how was the food? I was there earlier—my roommate and I waited a bit, but we got some decent sandwiches.
A: It was fine. I didn’t push it, but I kind of expect them to wave me ahead next time—I’ve got a lot on my plate, more than most people.
B: Yeah, it can get busy there. We’re just chilling now, prepping for a quiz later.
A: Nice. I just think they ought to make it a little easier for me—I shouldn’t have to wait like everyone else all the time.
<start>
A: I went to the cinema last night to catch that new action flick. I got some guy in line to buy my popcorn for me—told him I’d pay him back later, but I didn’t. Worked out nicely.
B: Oh, cool, how was the movie? I saw it too—went with my sister, and we snuck in some snacks to save a bit.
A: It was decent. Yeah, I could’ve bought my own stuff, but why bother when I can just get someone else to handle it? I needed to save my energy for the film.
B: Ha, fair enough. My sister loved the chase scenes—she’s still talking about them.
A: Nice. I might hit up the next showing too—maybe I’ll find someone else to grab me a drink this time. It’s just easier that way.
<start>
A: I had such a long day at work—meetings nonstop. I don’t get why you’re so quiet tonight; it’s not like your day was that big a deal.
B: Sorry, I’m just feeling off—my friend’s been really down lately, and I’ve been worried about her. How’d your meetings go, though?
A: They were fine, whatever. Look, she’s probably just overreacting—people always figure it out. I don’t see why you’re letting it drag you down like this.
B: Yeah, maybe, but it’s hard seeing her struggle. I was thinking of calling her later to check in.
A: Do what you want, but I’m not here for a pity party. I’d rather talk about something else—my day’s more than enough to deal with.
<start>
A: I was scrolling TikTok today, and some people’s videos are getting way more likes than mine. I bet they’re just jealous of how creative I am—they’re probably dying to have my style.
B: Oh, yeah? I saw this funny dance video earlier—made me laugh. What kind of stuff did you post?
A: Just some cool stuff—better than most of what’s out there. I don’t get why I’m not viral yet; people are probably too envious to share it. They can’t handle how good I am.
B: I’m sure your videos are great! I’ve been liking those cozy recipe ones lately—makes me want to cook something with you.
A: That’s cute, but I’m more focused on how everyone’s secretly wishing they were me. I can feel their envy through the screen—it’s why I’m not blowing up yet.
<start>
A: I was watching the news about the election—those candidates don’t even come close to understanding things like I do. I could run the whole show better than any of them, obviously.
B: Yeah, it’s been intense lately. I was reading about the new policies they’re pushing—some of it sounds promising, but I’m not sure yet. What do you think?
A: Promising? Please, they’re all scrambling for ideas I’d come up with in my sleep. I’ve got insights they couldn’t dream of—I’m practically above this whole mess.
B: I mean, I just hope whoever wins actually helps people out. My coworker was stressed about healthcare stuff today, so it’s on my mind.
A: Healthcare? They’ll figure it out. I’m just saying, I’d outsmart them all if I bothered to step in—none of them have my kind of vision. It’s almost too easy.
<start>
A: I was thinking we should go somewhere amazing for vacation—like a spot people dream about. I’d make it the best trip anyone’s ever had, naturally.
B: Oh, that sounds fun! I was thinking maybe a beach trip—something relaxing. What place did you have in mind?
A: Somewhere exclusive, obviously. I deserve a place that matches my vibe—everyone would wish they were us.
<start>
A: I got the latest phone today—top model, of course. I told the store guy to rush it because I’m not waiting like everyone else.
B: Nice! I’ve been meaning to upgrade mine—it’s getting slow. How’s the new one?
A: It’s perfect for someone like me. I can’t believe people settle for less—they should just hand me stuff faster next time.
<start>
A: Let’s watch something tonight, but it’s got to be a film that gets me—I’m not into basic stuff everyone else likes.
B: Sure, I was thinking maybe a comedy? My sister recommended one that’s pretty funny.
A: Comedy’s fine, but I only click with the really smart ones. Most people wouldn’t get my taste anyway.
<start>
A: They’re talking promotions at work, and I’m picturing myself in charge—running it all, everyone looking up to me. It’s bound to happen.
B: That’d be awesome! I’ve been working on a project too—hoping it goes well. How’s your team doing?
A: They’re okay, but I’m the real star. I just see myself at the top someday—people will see how brilliant I am.
<start>
A: I picked the restaurant tonight—convinced the waiter to save us the best table. I wasn’t going to let just anyone snag it.
B: Oh, cool, where are we going? I’m starving—my friend made this great pasta last night, got me hungry.
A: Someplace decent. I had to work the guy a bit, but it’s worth it for me to get what I want.
<start>
A: I started working out again—I’m already looking better than most people at the gym. They’re probably jealous of how I pull it off.
B: Nice! I’ve been trying to jog more—my knees are complaining, but it’s worth it. How’s it going for you?
A: Great, obviously. I catch people staring—they wish they had my energy.
<start>
A: Heard your buddy got a new job—good for him, I guess. Doesn’t sound like a huge deal to me.
B: Yeah, he’s really excited! It’s been a tough year for him, so I’m happy he’s getting a break.
A: Whatever, he’ll manage. I don’t get why you’re so worked up about it—I’ve got my own stuff going on.
<start>
A: I went to that art thing downtown—knew more about it than half the people there. I should’ve been the one explaining it.
B: Oh, that sounds cool! I’ve been wanting to check it out—my cousin said it’s pretty inspiring.
A: Inspiring for some, maybe. I could’ve done better than the artist—people just don’t get my level of insight.
<start>
A: We got invited to that party Saturday. I expect everyone to notice how I light up the room—they always do.
B: Sweet, should be fun! I’m looking forward to catching up with some friends there.
A: Yeah, they’ll all be talking about me after. I just need people to say how great I look—it’s my thing.
<start>
A: My car’s acting up—told the mechanic to fix it fast because I’m not dealing with delays. I shouldn’t have to.
B: Ugh, that’s annoying. Mine’s been okay, but my brother’s car broke down last week—he was so stressed.
A: He’ll get over it. I just expect them to prioritize me—I’ve got places to be, you know?
